<h1 id="conference-objective">Conference Objective</h1>

<ul>
<li>Developing a cross boardary online network for data standarisation in the East Adriatic</li>
<li>There are several projects conducted in the Adriatic but few have solid ground breaking outcomes</li>
<li>Nature conservation is only possible with transboundary protection/conservation/management measures, spesifically if the target animals have a long migration routes. Its already proven that inter connnected cross boardary protected habitats are the strongest step on both species and ecosystem level protection. The conference will create the first solid step on the way to cross boardary conservation measures.</li>
<li>The developed network will allow not only to standarise the data collection process according to its subject or taxa but also helps researchers to analyse data under the supervision of statistical experts.</li>
<li>Bringing together researchers and sharing the cro and pons of their research experiences</li>
<li>Nature conservation can only be effective with accurate scientific data behind. Over 100 projects in Balkans and Turkey supported by Rufford Small Grant and several project with same target species with the same aim. Yet, the differences on their methodology prevent to reach a common goal with transboundary conservation measures. Therefore the conference will organise a round table meeting and bring experts and researchers together to create a common data collection protocol. Thus, data collection will be standardised for an accurate, transboundary protection measures. Through the round table meetings, capacity buildings of the researchers will be achieved</li>
</ul>

<p>Berlin’s flat geography, its many bike lanes and the friendly weather in early May make it perfect to get around by bike! Check with your hotel or hostel if they have bikes to rent out, or find your perfect bike at one of the many bike rental places.</p>
