<h1 id="conference-mission">Conference mission</h1>

<p>Effective nature conservation is only possible with transboundary research efforts,
particularly if the target animals rely on long migration routes for their survival.
There are over 100 projects in the Balkans and Turkey supported by Rufford Small Grants,
many of which have the same target species and aims. However, with the differences in their methodology and scope,
the potential to reach a common goal and create transboundary conservation measures is diminished.
It has been already been proven that cross-boundary protected areas are the strongest
tool for the protection of both species and surrounding ecosystem.</p>

<p>Several research and nature conservation projects have been conducted in the Adriatic,
but only a few of them have obtained solid outcomes.
The development of a cross-border online network for the East Adriatic will not only allow
for a standardized data collection process, according to the subjects or taxa,
but it will also help researchers to analyse their data under the supervision of statistical experts.</p>

<p>This conference will create the perfect chance to establish these connections and start
planning the first steps towards transboundary conservation strategies, through
the development of a cross-border online network “Adriatic Nature Conservation Database”.</p>

<h1 id="organisation">Organisation</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.dmad.org.tr">DMAD</a>, the Marine Mammal Research Association, is a non-profit
organisation based in Turkey that aims to study marine mammal populations in the coastal waters of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.
<a href="http://www.montenegrodolphinproject.org/">The Montenegro Dolphin Project</a> was established in September 2016,
in partnership with the Natural History Association of Montenegro,
becoming the first long term research study on cetacean populations in Montenegrin waters.
Our purpose is to identify the population status, distribution patterns and main threats to cetaceans in order to
fill in scientific knowledge gaps and help implement effective conservations actions,
while also promoting awareness of nature conservation initiatives.</p>

<p><a href="http://naturalhistoryassociationofmontenegro.weebly.com/">Natural History Association of Montenegro (NHAM)</a> is a research organisation
whose aim is to study and preserve the biological diversity of Montenegro.
NHAM aims to generate robust, scientific data through a combination of laboratory
and field-based research efforts as well as collecting and processing scientific literature.
In addition, it aims to bring together scientists and experts together in order to inform management
and promote effective EU legislation. NHAM also aims to effectively communicate their
research through public awareness initiatives informing citizens of the state of Montenegro’s biodiversity.</p>

<h2 id="date-venue">Date &amp; Venue</h2>

<p>The DMAD and NHAM Rufford conference will take place from the <strong>3rd to the 6th of February, 2017</strong> at the Sidro Hotel, Bar, Montenegro.</p>

<h2 id="topics-and-language">Topics and Language</h2>

<p>The conference is open to a wide range of research projects related to nature
conservation and environmental issues within the Adriatic Region.</p>

<p>All talks and presentations must be in English.</p>

<h1 id="travel-transport-a-name-transport-a">Travel &amp; Transport<a name="transport"></a></h1>

<p>Bar is easily accessible by car, bus or train. Speakers coming from distant overseas countries can fly to Podgorica airport or Tivat airport.</p>

<p>Transport from either airport is straightforward with regular buses running to Bar. Hotel Sidro is just a short taxi ride from Bar bus station.</p>
