# Mission & Values

CSSconf EU is a not-for-profit community conference run by a team of volunteers. We are all active members of the tech community, and run or contribute to various free local meetups, workshops, and education initiatives. With CSSconf EU, we aim to bring the international CSS crowd together with our beloved local Berlin community. We are humbled to look back to three sold-out events where we welcomed the world’s most excellent CSS speakers on our stage, and we are proud to have always put an inclusive and welcoming culture first. We operate under a Code of Conduct, run a scholarship program, write articles to be transparent, and are committed to diversity and accessibility.


# Date & Venue

CSSconf EU will 2017 take place on May 5, 2017 in Berlin’s Arena Halle, offering a day packed with inspiring and insightful talks and time well spent in the company of great people. This year we’re planning the most adventurous and ambitious CSSconf EU ever – be prepared for CSSconf EU, the Festival Edition, featuring a newer, bigger, more exciting venue that we’ll pack with some surprises.

## Speakers, Topics, Language

CSSconf EU unites top international speakers and newcomers with fresh ideas. They will discuss cutting-edge technologies and questions around front-end development and web design – with a specific focus on CSS.

See full line-up and Schedule

Talks are always in English, and video recordings will be released for free after the event. All speakers were selected via an open Call for Speakers. The voting on all proposals took place in January 2017.

## Catering

Our chefs and coffee specialists will make sure you don’t go hungry or run the risk of low caffeination throughout the day. You can expect quality coffee, a full breakfast, healthy lunch with various options, and hearty dinner. All meals include vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free options.

## Tickets

Until sold out, you can buy tickets here.


## Travel & Transport

## Berlin’s Airports

Berlin has two airports, both of which are located close to the city center, a 30-minute taxi ride from the venue (ca. EUR 30). There are also trains and buses that connect the airports to Berlin’s city center.

Berlin-Tegel (TXL)
Berlin-Schönefeld (SXF)
Public Transport

Berlin has many public transport options. The subway, trains, buses, trams are all operated by BVG. We recommend getting one of the tourist tickets for the length of your stay – this will allow you to use all subway trains, trams and buses in all of Berlin, plus it comes with discounts for popular sights, museums, and other attractions.

## Bike

Berlin’s flat geography, its many bike lanes and the friendly weather in early May make it perfect to get around by bike! Check with your hotel or hostel if they have bikes to rent out, or find your perfect bike at one of the many bike rental places.

## Taxi

Taxis in Berlin are affordable and everywhere. You can usually hail one on the street, or use apps like MyTaxi to order one.
