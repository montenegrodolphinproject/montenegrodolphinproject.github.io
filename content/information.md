# Organisation

## DMAD
We are working on to fill the scientific knowledge gap on cetaceans in the Mediterranean Sea in hand with providing active community involvement to our research and conservation actions for the purpose of Marine Protected Area delineations. Currently, we coordinate three different projects all in successful manners, with solid outcomes in Turkey, Greece and Montenegro. We are aware that without the involvement of stakeholders and decision makers in equal importance with our scientific activities, project outcomes will be only paper based with no real life adapted regulations. The origin of our work is to line science, stakeholder, decisionmakers involvement in equal importance for an effective in field conservation implications to conserve the north-western Levantine Sea on the ecosystem level. Therefore, we have successfully organised public awareness campaigns and events (more than 20), in schools, universities and public halls, in addition to our ongoing systematic surveys in target habitats in the last 3 years.

## NHAM
In regards to NHAM, we are working on the conservation of ornithofauna, herpethofauna and cetaceans in the Mediterranean Sea. We are doing field research,conservation actions and education of local people and students, also work with stakeholder, decisionmakers, institutions. We have a lot of good experience with locals at Montenegro, and giving the best to fulfill our research and conservation goals

# Mission & Values

The conference plan to have two main outcomes;

1. The conference aim to form a bridge between the researchers and governmental bodies that focus both on the terrestrial and marine ecosystem. Previous Rufford conferences were mainly directed the attention to the terrestrial life so the proposed conference will like to give a special attention to bring the researchers of marine ecosystem and create a knowledge network between the two ecosystems.

2. Nature conservation can only be effective with accurate scientific data behind. Over 100 projects in Balkans and Turkey supported by Rufford Small Grant and several project with same target species with the same aim. Yet, the differences on their methodology prevent to reach a common goal with transboundary conservation measures. Therefore the conference will organise a round table meeting and bring experts and researchers together to create a common data collection protocol. Thus, data collection will be standardised for an accurate, transboundary protection measures. Through the round table meetings, capacity buildings of the researchers will be achieved,
